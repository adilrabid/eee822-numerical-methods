# eee822-numerical-methods
A practical course of Electrical and Electronics Engineering called Numerical Methods Laboratory based on MATLAB.

`Note:` All the codes has written using MATLAB version R2018b

## This repo includes the code for the following lab reports:
- Determination of roots of f(x) = 0 ( Algebraic or transcendental or comnination of both equation ).
-  Determination of roots of f(x) = 0 ( Algebraic or transcendental or comnination of both equation by bisection method ).
- Determination of roots of f(x) = 0 ( Algebraic or transcendental or
comnination of both equation by false position method ).
- Determinatin of roots of f(x) = 0 by Newtom Rapson Method.
- Determinatin of roots of f(x) = 0 by using Secant Method.
